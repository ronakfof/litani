Litani
=

Litani is a build system that provides an HTML dashboard of job results, as well
as a JSON-formatted record of job results. It provides platform-independent job
control (timeouts, return code control) and an output format that is easy to
render into reports (for example, using the built-in renderer).

### Documentation
